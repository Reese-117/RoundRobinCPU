Overview
The RoundRobinCPU.cpp program simulates a CPU scheduling algorithm using the Round Robin approach. This program is ideal for understanding how CPU scheduling works in operating systems, particularly how time slices (quantum) are allocated to processes.

Features
Simulation of the Round Robin CPU scheduling algorithm.
Handles process queue management and time slice distribution.
Demonstrates how processes are scheduled and cycled through.

Requirements
C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later (e.g., g++ or clang++).
Compilation

To compile the program, run:
g++ -std=c++11 -o RoundRobinCPU RoundRobinCPU.cpp

Running
After compilation, run the executable:
./RoundRobinCPU

Notes
The source code includes comments detailing the scheduling logic and simulation process.
Useful for educational purposes in courses related to operating systems or computer architecture.
